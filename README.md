- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rashmi Prabha
- ðŸ‘€ Founder and Educator on CombineCS. I love teaching and have been in this profile for over 10+ years now. 
My focus was never only on teaching, rather helping and guiding students to break down the problem statement, relate it to a real-life situation and then solve the problem.
